		<ul>

			<li>The game requires the player to guess the position of each battleships on a 7x7 squares grid. </li>
			<li>To place a hit on one of the grids squares, click on one of the squares. The player's guesses would either be hit or miss, both of which would have outputs to tell the player if they guessed right or not.</li>
			<li>If you click on the square that has no battleship, the square will turn grey.</li>
			<li>When the you click on the square that has a battleship, the square will turn red.</li>
			<li>The game will keep count on the number of shots you have taken as well as updating the battleship count every time you destroy a battleship.</li>
			<!--<li>When the player successfully destroys a ship, the caption box would output a caption saying what type of ship did the player destroyed. </li>
			<li>When the game is finished, the web page would output an alert box that congratulates the player and letting the player know the number of shots the player used.</li>
			<li>The caption box would also output a caption that lets the player know if they wish to restart the game they must refresh the page.</li>-->
