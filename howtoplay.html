			<li>The game requires the player to guess the position of each battleships on a 7x7 squares grid. </li>
			<li>To place a hit on one of the grids squares, click on one of the squares. The player's guesses would either be hit or miss, both of which would have outputs to tell the player if they guessed right or not.</li>
			<li>If you click on the square that has no battleship, the square will turn grey.</li>
			<li>When the you click on the square that has a battleship, the square will turn red.</li>
